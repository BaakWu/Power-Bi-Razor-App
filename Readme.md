# Power BI Embedded Razor App Sample

This application is part of a step by step guide of how to implement a Power Bi Embedded application into a .Net Core App using Razor Pages. This will also detail how the Power Bi Infrastructure works.

## What this Application Currently does

This Web app creates a index page listing links of Power BI reports based on your Power BI workspace. Clicking on the link will lead you to a page where the report is being embedded.

## Features in Progress by Priority 

 1. Row level Security (highest priority)
 2. Mobile view
 3. QNA
 4. Dashboards

## Requirements
 - Power Bi Pro Account
 - Power BI Registered Azure Application
 - Power BI Azure resource (optional in development, required in production)

## How Power Bi Embedded Works

How a Power BI report is emedded and rendered is that the server sends a Power Bi configuration settings (tokens, urls, ect) for the report guid specified by the user. The user uses these configuration settings and renders the Power BI report client side through JavaScript by calling `powerbi.embed(htmlContainer, reportConfigSettings)`

This produces an iFrame which connects to Microsoft and their Power BI Service directly, providing interactive reports and visuals. (Any interactions inside the iFrame are handled by Microsoft and not our servers)

This is unusual for web apps because it has 3 clients instead of the usual 2.

1.  Client Side (user of site)
2.  Server Side (standard .Net MVC server side rendering)
3.  Power BI Client (Microsoft's Power Bi service called by its APIs)

This is the workflow of responsibility on how a Report ID sent by the client turns into the embedded iframe.

``` js-sequence
participant iFrame
Client -> Reportal Server: Sends Report ID
Reportal Server -> PowerBi Server: Sends Report ID \n and Master Power BI \n Credentials
Power Bi Server -> Reportal Server: Sends report embed token
Reportal Server -> Client: Sends report config \n (with embed token)
Client -> iFrame :Embeds Power BI \n Report with config
```

_It's important to note that any interaction between the iFrame and the Client such as any interactive sorting functions or filtering functions of the report has nothing to do with the Reportal server. That is between Microsoft's Power BI service and The Client_

## How To Setup this App

### 1. Register your Power Bi Application with Azure AD
Go to https://dev.powerbi.com/apps and register a Power Bi Application to Azure AD, the list of permissions you need are the following.

 - Read All Datasets
 - Read All Groups
 - Read All Dashboards
 - Read All Reports

### 2. Configure your appsettings.json file 

Access the appsettings.json file and fill in the following information

![AppSettings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BaakWu/PowerBiRazorApp/master/ReadmeImages/AppSettingsRequirements.png)

To get the" TenantId", go to the azure portal for you or your organization (https://portal.azure.com) and find it under "Azure Active Directory" => "Properties" =>"Directory ID" the guid under there should be the "TenantId" 

![AzureTenantID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BaakWu/PowerBiRazorApp/master/ReadmeImages/AzureTenantID.png)

The "ClientId" should have been provided to you under the Power BI App registration tool in Step 1.
 
![AzureClientID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BaakWu/PowerBiRazorApp/master/ReadmeImages/AzureClientID.png)

If you want to find it under the Azure portal, navigate to "Azure Active Directory" => "App Registrations" => "(NAME OF YOUR APP)" => "Application ID"

![AzureClientID3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BaakWu/PowerBiRazorApp/master/ReadmeImages/AzureClientID3.png)
![AzureClientID2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BaakWu/PowerBiRazorApp/master/ReadmeImages/AzureClientID2.png)

The "MasterUser" should be any Microsoft account you have that has a Power Bi Pro license. Enter your username and password inside the "MasterUser," and "MasterKey." **Be sure to NEVER commit this information to a public repository.**

The "GroupId" is the "workspace" where your Power BI reports you wish to embed reside. They can be found going to https://app.powerbi.com/ => "(YOUR WORKSPACE NAME)" and should be Guid after the route "Group" in the URL.

![PowerBiGroupID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BaakWu/PowerBiRazorApp/master/ReadmeImages/PowerBIGroup.png)

Be sure that the MasterUser that you used above is an owner of that group/workspace, otherwise the MasterUser will not have permissions to embed the reports.

### 3. Build and launch the Application through IIS Express

![Launch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BaakWu/PowerBiRazorApp/master/ReadmeImages/LaunchApp.png)

After finishing Step 2. You should be able to launch the application through IIS Express in Visual Studio

### 4.Setting up Dedicated Capacity (Optional for Development, Required for Production)

The Power BI application will work without paying or providing dedicated capacity, however note that you are using the development capacity of Power BI embedded from Microsoft is not guaranteed for timely performance, and against the license agreement when used in production. 

To enable dedicated capacity, purchase a Power BI resource from the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com)

Create a resource and search for "Power Bi Embedded"

![Marketpalce](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BaakWu/PowerBiRazorApp/master/ReadmeImages/AzureMarketPlace.png)
![Marketpalce2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BaakWu/PowerBiRazorApp/master/ReadmeImages/AzureMarketPlace2.png)

Purchase your resource with the appropriate subscription and pricing tier for your situation.
![ResourcePurchase](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BaakWu/PowerBiRazorApp/master/ReadmeImages/ResourcePurchase.png)


Go to https://app.powerbi.com/ and edit your Power BI workspace under "Edit workspace"
Go under "Advanced" and enable "Dedicated capacity" (May take a while) and choose the resource you purchased above.

![WorkspaceOptions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BaakWu/PowerBiRazorApp/master/ReadmeImages/WorkspaceOptions.png)
![Embedded Capacity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BaakWu/PowerBiRazorApp/master/ReadmeImages/EnableEmbeddedCapacity.png)


After saving, you should see a diamond on your workspace, the reports from that workspace should now use purchased "dedicated capacity" rather than "development capacity."
